# CakeShop
MVC 5 project using Entity Framework, React, AutoFAC.

React for forming the front-end and axios for retrieving data from the RESTful API end point.
Administration back-end using model binding with the ability to modify database records using CRUD operations.
Database is SQL server 2016. Entity Framework was used along with migrations to populate data and maintain.

The project is a online shop built with MVC to buy cakes with a functioning collapsible shopping basket. 

The shopping basket can be populated with cakes, with total prices and ability to remove cakes. Checkout is disabled if the basket is empty. Most of the styling is inline css, however, I prefer using css-modules in a full project.
